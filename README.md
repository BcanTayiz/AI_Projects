# 🚀 **AI Projects with Streamlit**

I’m building **unique, experimental, and creative AI projects** using Python, Streamlit, and various machine learning techniques.  
Each project reflects a different idea, challenge, or curiosity I wanted to explore.

## 🔖 **Project Status Labels**

| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| ⭐ **In Progress** | Actively being developed — ambitious, complex, evolving. |
| 🟡 **Not Completed** | Functional but open-ended. Could be extended in many directions. |
| ⚫ **Trial** | Early experiment or abandoned concept. Valuable for learning, but not continued. |

## 🧠 **AI-Based Task Manager** — ⭐ *In Progress*

An experimental **self-learning task manager** powered by a custom RNN model.

### ✨ Highlights
- Starts with **dummy tasks** and calculates priority using CPU/RAM usage.  
- Continuously logs data and **trains itself** to improve scoring accuracy.  
- Learns system behavior over time and evolves its decision-making.  
- Combines:
  - Real-time system stats  
  - AI-based scoring  
  - Traditional scoring formulas  
  - Weighted hybrid decision logic  

A unique and evolving idea — something between a task manager, scheduler, and AI experiment.

## 📝 **Generating Poetic Texts** — 🟡 *Not Completed*

A lightweight text-generation project.

### ✨ Features
- Based on a simple RNN/LSTM text generator.  
- Wrapped in Streamlit for instant interaction.  
- Adjustable **temperature** for creative control.  
- Produces short poetic or abstract text based on training data.

A classic ML project, but reimagined with interactive UI.

## 📡 **Real-Time Sentiment Analysis** — ⚫ *Trial*

A challenging attempt at performing **continuous real-time sentiment analysis**.

### 🧪 What happened
- Processing live updates was expensive.  
- Rapid API calls and continuous model inference made the system unstable.  
- The idea was promising but became too resource-heavy too quickly.

Still — a valuable learning experiment.
